My name is Lei Wang.  I am a software engineer. I live in Xi'an, China.
I love this course very much and I learn a lot from it. Now I'm building my first personal knowledge retriever RAG system.
I will go to sanya at 2026-02-14 to see my daughter. I haven't see her about half a month. So every day I will call her because I miss her.
She is a 2 years old girl. She is very cute and she likes to play with me.
